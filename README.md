I enjoy the idea of infrastructure as code. I love mulling over how to automate stuff. I love consuming APIs. These things spark joy!

I'm a big time music head, been producing as a hobby since 1999 across various platforms. My instruments of choice are keys/synths, drums and guitar in that order pretty much.

These repos are going to just be various bits and bobs of code from classes I take, weird ideas I have and fun projects.
