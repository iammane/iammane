Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matt; novice coder, security enthusiast, dad, musician. I enjoy the idea of infrastructure as code. I love mulling over how to automate stuff. I love consuming APIs. These things spark joy!

I'm the founder of @complexrobotworks, a small web/logo design shop. More info here https://complexrobot.net.

I'm a big time music head, been producing as a hobby since 1999 across various platforms. My instruments of choice are keys/synths, drums and guitar in that order pretty much. Any of the new stuff is branded under *industry city sleepers*. https://soundcloud.com/icsleepers.
