I'm the founder of @complexrobotworks, a small to medium business technology shop specializing in general IT needs, cybersecurity posture, web/logo design and hosting solutions. More info here [complex robot](https://complexrobot.works).

I'm a big time music head, been producing as a hobby since 1999 across various platforms. My instruments of choice are keys/synths, drums and guitar in that order pretty much.
