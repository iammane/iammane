I'm the founder of @complexrobotworks, a small web/logo design shop. More info here [complex robot](https://complexrobot.net).

I'm a big time music head, been producing as a hobby since 1999 across various platforms. My instruments of choice are keys/synths, drums and guitar in that order pretty much. Any of the new stuff is branded under *industry city sleepers*. [industry city sleepers @ SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/icsleepers/tracks).
